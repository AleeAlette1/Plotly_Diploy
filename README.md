# Belly-Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset that catalogs the microbes that live in human navels. Specifically, a Horizontal Bar Chart, Bubble Chart and Gauge Chart should display data pertaining to the top 10 bacterial species in belly buttons. 

## Results
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset reveals that a small handful of micobial species (refered to as operational taxonomic units, OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
